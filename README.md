# PythonDataDrivenRom4BoltzmannEq
This project is a collection of Python Code covering a variety of tasks related to development of ROM for Boltzmann equation, 
NN approximations for the Boltzmann collision integral and related questions. 

The code consists of two types of files: the program main files and library modules. The program main files arepeices of code 
dedicated to a specific goal. The goal could be training a Neural Network, testing accuracy of the NN, visualizing results, 
solve Boltzmann equation, or generate plotting files for graphing software. Consider all of the available files as templates. 
Please create a branch, modify, use for the goal you would like to address. We may or may not merge the brach in the end. 

Libraries, on the other hand, are intended to be consistent and we will try to maintain a fully functional version that evolves 
and grows. So, we will be merging and committing branches as necessary. 

Here is a list of program main files with a brief description:
